Your account likely has a ton of personal data and connections that could benefit a hacker. The more you understand about how a hacker can access your password, the savvier you will be at keeping it safe.<br><br>Advertisement<br><br>Here are seven sneaky ways hackers can access your password and what you can do to stop them.<br><br>Suspicious Emails\r\nYou have probably heard many times by now not to open suspicious emails. This is still true today. But fake emails have become much more sophisticated than in the past. Fake emails might appear to be from Facebook and have all the formatting and logos you expect in a legitimate email. It can be very difficult to determine if an email is fake.<br><br>Advertisement<br><br>There are a multitude of ways a hacker can use a suspicious email to gain access to your Facebook account. The best way to avoid this is to delete the email and do not click on anything in the email. It is best to not even open suspicious emails.<br><br>If Facebook has to reach you, they can do so from your Facebook account. If you get an email from “Facebook”, instead of opening the email, log into your account to see if you have a notification there. Do not trust any emails that ask for account information, request money, or threaten to suspend your account.<br><br>Phishing\r\nThe purpose of many fake emails is phishing. Phishing is when someone asks for personal information that they can use to gain access to your account. A common way to phish is to trick someone to sign in on a fake site.<br><br>Some hackers will go through the trouble of creating a fake website that looks the same as Facebook. But, you can avoid this trap. It is always best to go to Facebook rather than click on a link. If you do use a link, carefully read the email address. Does it look correct, or is Facebook misspelled? Finally, check for the secure icon in the web address before signing in.<br><br>Advertisement<br><br>Fake Facebook Buttons\r\nYou might know not to trust links, but don’t forget that “like” and “share” buttons act like links. Clicking on one of these buttons on a fake site might lead you to a fake login page designed to steal your information.<br><br>To avoid this, sign in to your Facebook account from a new tab in your browser. Your browser will keep you logged in on other tabs. Now, any likes or shares will go directly to Facebook. If you still get a prompt to login, it\'s a good indicator that the button was fake.<br><br>Password Spraying\r\nComing up with a password is hard. It can be tempting to use something like “123456789”. Of course, that is a bad idea; it is too easy to guess. But many people do use similar easy passwords. Because of this, many hackers employ password spraying. This is when they guess a password by using the most common passwords.<br><br>It is hard to remember a random alphanumeric sequence. So, more people use words, which limits the number of potential passwords available. When creating a password, it is best to use a unique phrase, replace some of the letters with numbers, and vary the capitalization. And definitely avoid any variation of the word “password”, including pa$$word123.<br><br>Plain Password Grabbing\r\nOnce you come up with a good password, make sure you only use it for your Facebook account. If you use the same password everywhere, you leave yourself vulnerable to Plain Password Grabbing. This is when a hacker attacks a more vulnerable and less secure site. Some sites do not properly encrypt passwords. In that case, a hacker can then use the email and password saved in the database to try to access other sites like Facebook.<br><br>If you have a lot of accounts that require passwords, consider using a password manager. Often, they will generate strong passwords for you too.<br><br>Keylogging\r\nKeylogging is a more advanced hacking technique. It requires installing a program on your device to track everything that you type. This can give hackers far more information than just your Facebook login information. They could even get credit card information using this method.<br><br>But, because a hacker needs to install a keylogging program on your device, it is a little easier to protect yourself against this sort of attack. Generally, hackers hide these programs in other software. To stay safe, do not download anything from an untrusted source. Your computer’s security software can detect these programs, but you might want to get anti-malware software for your smartphone. Make sure to keep your security software up to date too.<br><br>Unsecured Networks\r\nEven if you have the best passwords, and are using the most secure computer, it won’t help if the network you are using is not secure. Public Wi-Fi is often unsecured. Unsecure networks allow hackers to snoop through all the data that you send and received from webpages while on that network.<br><br>Instead of using free Wi-Fi to access Facebook on the go, sign in using mobile data. It will ensure that your data is more secure. Or consider getting a virtual private network (VPN). Many VPN providers will encrypt your data, which will protect it even if you are connecting to the internet on an unsecured network.<br><br>Facebook Security in a Nutshell\r\nOur growing dependence on the internet means that we need to be a little more careful online. All the security information out there can be a little overwhelming. But it all boils down to a couple of simple tips. Use unique passwords for all your accounts. Do not click on any links that you do not trust (even if it looks like they are from Facebook). Do not download anything unless you are certain if it is safe. Do not enter sensitive information on public computers or across public Wi-Fi. If in doubt, error on the side of caution.', '2022-03-06 13:07:13', 'https://images.techopedia.com/images/uploads/32c2de071eab4624a5cc169280488f4a.jpg?w=800&h=0&mode=max&quality=70&scale=both', 1),
(2, 2, 'Explainable AI Isn\'t Enough; We Need Understandable AI', 'In the world of artificial intelligence (AI), explainable AI (XAI) has gained an incredible amount of attention in the past few years. Many are emphasizing how important it is to the future of artificial intelligence and machine learning. (Also read: Why Does Explainable AI Matter Anyway?)<br><br>Advertisement<br><br>And it is important—but it is not the solution. The desire to explain black box systems\' decisions is good; but XAI tools or methods alone will never be enough. If we want to provide full assurance for these systems’ decisions, we should be discussing how to deliver “understandable AI” instead.<br><br>XAI Is Hot Right Now for the Right Reasons<br><br>More and more, AI systems are making important decisions that impact our daily lives.<br><br>Advertisement<br><br>From insurance claims and loans to medical diagnoses and employment, enterprises are using AI and machine learning (ML) systems with increasing frequency. However, consumers have become increasingly wary of artificial intelligence. For instance, in the realm of insurance, a mere 17% of consumers trust AI to review their insurance claims because they cannot comprehend how these black box systems reach their decisions. (Also read: Has a Global Pandemic Changed the World\'s View of AI?)<br><br>Explainability for AI systems is practically as old as the field itself. In recent years, academic research has produced many promising XAI techniques and a number of software companies have emerged to provide XAI tools to the market. The issue, though, is that all of these approaches view explainability as a purely technical problem. In reality, the need for explainability and interpretability in AI is a much larger business and social problem—one that requires a more comprehensive solution than XAI can offer.<br><br>XAI Only Approximates the Black Box<br><br>It is perhaps easiest to understand how XAI works through an analogy. So, consider another black box: the human mind.<br><br>We all make decisions; and we\'re more or less aware of the reasons behind those decisions (even when we’re asked to explain them!). Now imagine yourself (the XAI) observing another person\'s (the original AI model) actions and inferring the rationale behind those actions. How well does that generally work for you?<br><br>Advertisement<br><br>With XAI, you are using a second model to interpret the original model. The “explainer” model is a best guess at the inner workings of the original model’s black box. They might approximate what is happening in the black box; they might not. How well should we expect it to approximate and “explain” non-human decisions? We can’t really know. Compounding this problem is how different model types require different explainers, which makes them more burdensome to manage alongside their respective models.<br><br>An attractive alternative is to design so-called “interpretable” models that provide visibility into the decision logic by design. Some excellent recent research suggests that such \"white box\" models may perform just as well as black box ones in some domains. But even these models have a significant downside: They are still often not understandable for non-technical people.<br><br>Explainable to Whom?<br><br>Another quick thought experiment: Imagine the imperfect explanations of XAI were, instead, perfect. Now, invite someone who isn’t a data scientist to review the model’s decisions—say, an executive in charge of a billion-dollar line of business who needs to decide whether to greenlight a high-impact ML model. (Also read: The Top 6 Ways AI Is Improving Business Productivity in 2021.)<br><br>The model could create an enormous competitive advantage and generate massive top-line revenue. It could also damage the company’s brand permanently or hurt the company’s stock price if the model runs amok. So it’s safe to say that executive would want some proof before the model goes live.<br><br>Looking at the outputs of some explainer models, what they would find is basically gobbledygook. That is to say, it is unreadable, decontextualized data with none of the attributes or logic they would expect when they hear the word “explanation.”<br><br>Herein lies the biggest issue for XAI as a field for use in the enterprise. Plus, interpretable models have the same issue for everyday people: The explanations require translation from technologists. The business executive, the risk organization, the compliance manager, the internal auditor, the chief counsel’s office and the board of directors cannot understand these explanations independently. What about the end user the model impacts?<br><br>Because of this, achieving trust and confidence becomes hard. External parties like regulators, consumer advocates and customers will find even less comfort.<br><br>The fact is, most \"Explainable\" AI tools are only explainable to a person with a strong technical background and deep familiarity with how that model operates. XAI is an important piece of the technologist’s toolkit—but it is not a practical or scalable way to “explain” AI and ML systems\' decisions.<br><br>Understandable AI: Transparency and Accessibility<br><br>The only way we’re going to get to the promised land of trust and confidence in decisions made by black box AI and ML is by enriching the explanatory domain and broadening its audience. What we need is “Understandable AI”—or AI that satisfies non-technical stakeholders\' needs in addition to XAI tools for technical teams.<br><br>The foundation for understandability is transparency. Non-technical people should have access to every decision made by the models they oversee. They should be able to search a system of record, based on key parameters, to evaluate the decisions individually and in aggregate. They should be able to perform a counterfactual analysis on individual decisions, changing specific variables to test whether the results are expected or not. (Also read: AI\'s Got Some Explaining to Do.)<br><br>But we shouldn’t stop there. Understandable AI also needs to include the larger context in which the models operate. To build trust, business owners should have visibility into the human decision-making that preceded and accompanied the model throughout its life cycle. Here are just a handful of the vital questions everyone around a model should ask themselves:<br><br>Why was this particular model considered the best choice for the business problem being addressed? What other options were considered; and why were they ruled out?<br><br>What risks and limitations were identified during the selection process? How were they mitigated?<br><br>What data was selected for inclusion in the model? How was it evaluated for appropriateness and potential problems?<br><br>Were the data sources internal or external to the company? If third-party data was used, what assurances did vendors provide regarding their data governance practices?<br><br>What did we learn during model development and training? How did those learnings inform the final product?<br><br>How is our company ensuring problems are identified and rectified once the model is live in production?<br><br>Conclusion: XAI is One Piece of the Understandable AI Solution<br><br>Explainability alone will not solve the problem of understanding how an AI or ML model is behaving. However, it can—and should—be an important piece of the larger Understandable AI picture.<br><br>With careful selection and design, these tools provide invaluable insight for the expert modeler and technical teams, particularly before a model is put into production. But if companies innovating with these intelligent models today do not consider their non-technical stakeholders\' needs, they will almost certainly endanger the success of many important projects—projects that could benefit the public and the companies developing them.', '2022-03-06 16:07:28', 'https://images.techopedia.com/images/uploads/understandable_ai.jpg?w=800&h=0&mode=max&quality=70&scale=both', 1),
(5, 3, 'An Introduction to Application Software', 'Whether creating a presentation for work, searching for a mate or just wanting to find out where to buy a box of Girl Scout cookies, there’s probably an app out there to help you do it. Unfortunately, there’s no app that actually explains what an app, short for application software, actually is or does. Here, we’ll take a high-level view of this term, including what it means, how it’s used and how it has evolved – and you don’t even need an app to read it.<br><br>What Is Application Software?<br>Computer software is the set of instructions and data that tells a computer what to do and how to do it. Software provides instructions to your computer’s hardware. Without it, your PC or Mac would be little more than a large paperweight. But software actually comes in three main types: system software, programming software and application software. System software includes all the stuff that makes up a computer\'s operating system (OS), including device drivers, configuration files and other key system components. This is the software that tells the computer’s hardware what to do and provides a foundation for the system. Programming software, or middleware, works much like the plumbing in your home by invisibly keeping things running behind the scenes. Application software, however, is the most important type for computer users because it is used to achieve many of the tasks that make us turn to our computers in the first place, such as word processing, web browsing and data crunching.<br><br>Application software applies the power of system software. This is why when downloading software, you have to find a version that is compatible with your running operating system. In essence, that software draws on the OS to create a Word document, spreadsheet or PowerPoint presentation.<br><br>Applications from A to Z<br>As you may have surmised, there’s a world of application software out there. The reason is simple: Computers are used to complete a very diverse set of tasks. Thus, the application software category includes the following types:<br><br>Application Suite<br><br>This refers to multiple and related bundled applications, such as Microsoft Office, which includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote and possibly others, depending on your suite version.<br><br>Content Access Software<br><br>This software is used to access and view content without manipulating it and includes browsers and media players.<br><br>Database Software<br><br>A database is a type of electronic filing system for the information used by various computer programs. Database software acts as the filing clerk for this system by keeping everything organized and storing, modifying and extracting database information. Large organizations use industrial-strength database systems like Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server. At a less intense level, you\'ll see database systems like Microsoft Access and MySQL.<br><br>Educational Software<br><br>Designed for teaching or learning, educational software applications are able to run tests, track programs and include software, such as MATLAB.<br><br>Enterprise Software<br><br>Enterprise software refers to applications businesses use to solve business-level problems. This category includes software for billing, payment processing and human resource (HR) management. (Learn more about this category in Enterprise Computing: What\'s All the Buzz?)<br><br>Information Worker Software<br><br>This type of software is closely related to enterprise software, but it refers to the applications used by the individual employees of a business to create and manage information. Examples include word processors, spreadsheets and media editors.<br><br>Multimedia Software<br><br>Multimedia software allows users to create and experience text, graphics, video and animation in an integrated way. There is some overlap with content access software, but multimedia software is specific to multimedia and includes applications like VLC Media Player, Windows Media Player and Winamp.<br><br>Presentation Software<br><br>If you’ve ever created a slideshow presentation, you are already familiar with this type of application. Presentation software is designed to arrange information for use in a demonstration or display. Examples include Microsoft PowerPoint, Keynote and SlideRocket.<br><br>Product Engineering Software<br><br>This type of software is essentially an application for applications and used to design and develop software products. The integrated development environments (IDE) and programming tools used by software developers fall into this category.<br><br>Simulation Software<br><br>Simulation software models real phenomena by using a set of mathematical formulas. This application type is used for research and design, as well as entertainment. Simulation software applications include flight simulators, weather simulators and feedback control systems.<br><br>Spreadsheet Software<br><br>Spreadsheet applications allow users to compile data and perform calculations in a spreadsheet format. Common examples include Microsoft Excel, Lotus 1-2-3 and Apple Numbers.<br><br>Word Processing Software<br><br>Nearly everyone has experience with word processing applications. Whether writing a letter or creating a resume, this software allows you to create and edit these documents. Common examples of word processing software include Microsoft Word, iWork and Google Docs.<br><br>Applications and Platforms<br>In recent years, classifying applications according to computing platforms has become more complicated. A platform is the hardware/software combination in which an application runs. In the early days of computing, this amounted to a computer operating system, which is why some software works with a Windows operating system, while other software operates only on iOS or Unix. Over the years, however, a few dimensions have been added with the development of new software delivery methods. The buzzword for this phenomenon is cloud computing, which means that many applications no longer rely on operating systems. Rather, they run on the web and may be accessed through a browser.<br><br>As you may have guessed, the final application platform – increasingly becoming the most important – is the mobile platform.<br><br>From Applications to Apps<br>Apps for mobile devices have become a huge part of the application software market, leading to the ubiquitous use of the term \"app.\" In fact, in most cases, this term is used to refer to a mobile application. As it turns out, this shortened version of the term is very apt when it comes to mobile applications because this type of software is often much smaller and more specific than that on a PC. So, while a slick software suite provides full functionality, an app usually has a narrow and specific function – or very little function at all, as many mobile applications are designed for entertainment. (To learn more about mobile apps, see Mobile Device Management vs. Mobile Application Management: The Big Fight Continues.)<br><br>This type of application was popularized by Apple through its App Store, where applications are sold for a few dollars apiece. These apps work only on Apple devices. So, other companies have followed Apple’s lead, creating apps for Android and BlackBerry devices. In fact, in 2015, more than 200 million apps were downloaded – per day – totaling 75 billion apps for the year. In 2016, that number jumped to 90 billion apps, lending credit to the notion that there truly is an app for just about everything you could imagine (and several things you couldn\'t ... or wouldn\'t want to).<br><br>An App to Predict the Future … of Apps<br>As with all things in technology, the evolution of application software is likely to take some unexpected turns. In the near future, however, we can expect to see less emphasis on traditional desktop PC software and an increasing shift to cloud and mobile applications. This represents potential privacy and security risks, and benefits, in terms of user accessibility. Maybe the next stop is applications that better balance these risks and rewards. This may be the future users want, but will they get it? So far, there’s no app to predict that.', '2022-03-06 16:42:28', 'https://images.techopedia.com/images/uploads/92c11d5cff6e43f299d55f5e66fc9ebf.jpg?w=800&h=0&mode=max&quality=70&scale=both', 1);
